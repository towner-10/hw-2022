Question: How to Be a Better Stage Actor
Part title: Learning from Experience
Step 1: Meet a wide array of people and observe them.

Paragraph: 
People watching is a great way to learn how to mimic expressions, gestures, and tones of voice. Observe strangers while you’re out and about, and try to interact with a diverse range of people. Paying attention can inspire you to come up with the details that make a performance great.

- Coffee shops, restaurant patios, malls, and grocery stores are all great people watching places. If you're in line somewhere, say hello to the people next to you and try to strike up a conversation.

Step 3: Become a bishop

Paragraph: 
A bishop is essentially the chief priest (or pastor) of a diocese. A diocese is the territory or region that contains the churches under a bishop's authority. An archbishop governs his diocese (called an archdiocese) and also oversees other bishops. The pope is responsible for choosing all bishops, including archbishops. Therefore, you need to make a good impression on those who advise him.

- Make sure that you are in regular communication with the archbishop for your region. He will be able to offer a positive recommendation when asked for his opinion about you.
- Bishops gather for regular meetings, where they set policy and liturgical standards for their region.
- The pope is responsible for appointing bishops and archbishops. He relies on existing bishops to provide him with recommendations.
- Remember, you cannot formally apply to become a bishop or archbishop. You must be appointed.
- The pope's chief adviser in this process is the Apostolic Nuncio. He is the pope's representative to the government and church hierarchy in individual countries.

Step 4: Become a cardinal.

Paragraph: 
A cardinal is a bishop who is chosen by the pope to receive this special designation. The pope selects archbishops to serve as cardinal of a specific diocese. Cardinals can either work at the Vatican or running their own archdioceses. Not all regions have a cardinal.

- Areas with significant Catholic populations, such as Manila, Boston, and Baltimore, are often where the pope chooses to create a cardinal.
- Make sure you live in a region that has a cardinal. You will not be likely to rise to this position from a small, rural population.
- When you are a bishop, maintain a positive relationship with the cardinal of your area. Make it clear that you are eager to serve the Church, and demonstrate your effective administrative skills.
- Cardinals are active in the administration of the Catholic church.
- There is not a formal application or interview process to become a cardinal. You must be appointed by the pope.

Question: How to Buy Silver Bars
Part title: Purchasing Bars Safely
Step 1: Ask your bank about trusted silver dealers near you.

Paragraph: 
Many banks sell silver, so you can start your search for a dealer by visiting your local branch. While you should feel free to compare prices, banks often sell their silver at less of a markup than other dealers. Even if your bank does not sell silver, they will likely be able to give you reliable advice on trusted dealers in your community.

- You can also search online to see if you can find reliable information about silver dealers in your area. Make sure you’re getting your information from a site you can trust, like that of a known news organization in your area.
- If you’ve found a dealer you’re interested in but have reservations, contact your local consumer protection bureau or your state’s attorney general to see if any complaints have been filed against the dealer

Step 3: Research the spot price of silver before making a deal.

Paragraph: 
The spot price of silver is the current price of the metal on the market. Silver bars are usually sold a little over this price. The more you know about the current price of silver, the surer you can be that you’re getting a good deal for the money you’re paying.

- If the dealer is asking well over the spot price, be extremely cautious when deciding whether or not to make the purchase.

Question: How to Calculate Precision
Part title: Calculating the Average Deviation
Step 1: Find the mean of the data.

Paragraph: 
The average deviation is a more detailed measure of the precision of a group of measurements or experiment values. The first step in finding the average deviation is to calculate the mean of the measured values. The mean is the sum of the values, divided by the number of measurements taken.

- For this example, use the same sample data as before. Assume that five measurements have been taken, 11, 13, 12, 14, and 12. The mean of these values is (11+13+12+14+12)/5=12.4.
---
Write a paragraph about a step in the question:
Question: How to Calculate Precision
Part title: Calculating the Average Deviation
Step 2: Calculate the absolute deviation of each value from the mean.

Paragraph: 
For this calculation of precision, you need to determine how close each value is to the mean. To do this, subtract the mean from each number. For this measurement, it does not matter whether the value is above or below the mean. Subtract the numbers and just use the positive value of the result. This is also called the absolute value.

- Algebraically, the absolute value is shown by placing two vertical bars around the calculation, as follows:
   - Absolute Deviation=|x-mu |
   - For this calculation, x represents each of the experimental values, and mu is the calculated mean.
- For the values of this sample data set, the absolute deviations are:
   - |12-12.4|=0.4
   - |11-12.4|=1.4
   - |14-12.4|=1.6
   - |13-12.4|=0.6
   - |12-12.4|=0.4

Step 3: Find the average deviation.

Paragraph: 
Use the absolute deviations and find their mean. As you did with the original data set, you will add them together and divide by the number of values. This is represented algebraically as:

- Average deviation = (sum of (x - mu)) / n
- For this sample data, the calculation is: 
   - Average deviation = (0.4 + 1.4 + 1.6 + 0.6 + 0.4) / 5
   - Average deviation = 4.4/5
   - Average deviation = 0.88

Step 4: Report the precision result.

Paragraph: 
This result may be reported as the mean, plus or minus the average deviation. For this sample data set, this result would look like 12.4±0.88. Note that reporting precision as the average deviation makes the measurement appear much more precise than with the range.

Question: How to Calculate Precision
Part title: Deciding How to Report Precision
Step 1: Use the word precision correctly.

Paragraph: 
Precision is a term that describes the level of repeatability of measurements. When collecting a group of data, either by measurement or through an experiment of some kind, the precision describes how close together the results of each measurement or experiment are going to be.

- Precision is not the same as accuracy. Accuracy measures how close experimental values come to the true or theoretical value, while precision measures how close the measured values are to each other.
- It is possible for data to be accurate but not precise or to be precise but not accurate. Accurate measurements are close to the target value but may not be close to each other. Precise measurements are close to each other, whether or not they are close to the target.
---
Write a paragraph about a step in the question:
Question: How to Calculate Precision
Part title: Deciding How to Report Precision
Step 2: Choose the best measure of precision.

Paragraph: 
The word “precision” does not have a single meaning. You can represent precision using several different measurements. You need to decide the best one.

- Range. For small data sets with about ten or fewer measurements, the range of values is a good measure of precision. This is particularly true if the values appear reasonably closely grouped. If you see one or two values that appear far from the others, you may wish to use a different calculation.
- Average deviation. The average deviation is a more accurate measure of precision for a small set of data values.
- Standard deviation. The standard deviation is perhaps the most recognized measure of precision. Standard deviation may be used to calculate the precision of measurements for an entire population or a sample of the population.

Write a paragraph about a step in the question:
Question: How to Calculate Precision
Part title: Deciding How to Report Precision
Step 3: Report your results clearly.

Paragraph: 
Very often, investigators will report data by giving the mean of the measured value, followed by a statement of the precision. The precision is shown with a “±” symbol. This provides an indication of precision, but it does not clearly explain to the reader if the number following the “±” symbol is a range, standard deviation, or some other measurement. To be very clear, you should define what measure of precision you are using, either in a footnote or parenthetical note.

- For example, for one series of data, the result could be reported as 12.4±3. However, a more explanatory way to report the same data would be to say “Mean=12.4, Range=3.”

Question: How to Care for a Cast Iron Skillet
Part title: Washing the Skillet After Use
Step 1: Wash it right after use.

Paragraph: 
Try to get to it before the food you cook has a chance to crust over the skillet. This makes cleanup a lot easier. Simply wipe out the food scraps with a sponge and then rinse the skillet with hot water.

You can use a touch of regular dish soap to help dislodge sticky food, but don't use too much. Never use bleach or any kind of harsh cleanser.
Never put your cast iron skillet in the dishwasher. The detergent will corrode the iron.

Step 2: Remove built-up food with salt and vinegar.

Paragraph: 
If the bottom of the skillet has a layer of caked-on food, make a mixture of coarse salt and vinegar and use a paper towel to rub it around the bottom of the skillet. It's easier on the iron than a scrub brush would be, and less likely to remove the nonstick seasoning.

You can also burn off caked food. Turn up the oven to 500 °F (260 °C) and put the skillet inside for an hour or so. The food will turn to ash, and you'll be able to brush it off and rinse the skillet.
However, if you use this method you'll need to re-season the skillet, since that will get burned off as well.

Paragraph: 
To season a brand new cast iron skillet, you rub it with oil and bake the oil into the surface of the cast iron. This builds up a nonstick coating, called the ""seasoning,"" that keeps the skillet from rusting and creates the perfect surface for cooking everything from scrambled eggs to pancakes to cobblers.

Use hot, soapy water and a scrub brush to scrub the skillet completely clean. This will remove any chemicals or other residues from the skillet so they don't get trapped in the seasoning.

After this first washing, you won't be using a scrub brush on the skillet again, since it will take off the precious seasoning you'll be working to preserve.

Step 3: Coat the skillet with fat.

Paragraph: 
You can use flaxseed, vegetable shortening, or olive oil. Use a paper towel to rub the fat into the skillet all over. The fat will bake into the skillet and fuse with the iron to become a layer of seasoning. You won't be able to taste or smell it once the process is complete.
Try not to miss any spots when you're covering the skillet with fat. If you miss a spot, it won't get a coating of seasoning, and will be more prone to rusting.

If you'd like, you can repeat it one more time to make extra sure that the seasoning won't strip off when you cook your first meal in the skillet. After this initial seasoning, the oil you use when you cook food will keep the skillet in good shape. Every time you cook a meal, the nonstick surface will improve.

Part title: Dealing with Rust
Step 1: Soak the skillet in a vinegar solution.

Paragraph: 
This will eliminate the rust, and it works no matter whether you have a few spots or the entire skillet has gotten rusty. Get a big pot large enough to hold the skillet. Fill it with a solution of half white vinegar, half water. Place the skillet in the pot and make sure it's completely submerged. Soak it for at least 3 hours so the vinegar has time to dissolve the rust.

When you remove the skillet, check for rust. If you still see rust spots, use a scrub brush to scrub them away.
Don't soak the skillet for more than 4 hours, or the iron will start to degrade. You just want to soak it long enough to take off the rust.

Paragraph: 
Before overhauling your diet and eating habits, it's a good idea to journal about where you currently are with your diet. Journaling is a great place to start because it gives you an insight into where your starting point is. It makes you realize your strengths and makes you aware of your weaknesses.  A journal can also help you keep yourself accountable as you develop new, healthy eating habits.

Keep track of all your food and beverages for at least one week.  Try to be as accurate as you can when you're tracking your food.  Even a few bites while you prepare meals should be accounted for.
Don't forget to track how many ounces of clear, hydrating fluids you drink.  This is an area that's also an important part of healthy eating.
After you've kept your journal for a few days, star or highlight areas where you think you could make changes.  For example, you might notice you don't drink enough water or typically skip breakfast.  These are great areas where you can make healthy changes.

Eating a healthy diet is only part of the battle. Eating on a scheduled regimen is equally, if not more, important. You should realize that eating too often or not often enough can cause gaps in your day, lowering metabolism and causing irregular cravings. It's important that we're nourished adequately throughout the day to prevent fatigue, grogginess and to perform at an optimal level.

It's important to eat regular, consistent meals each day.  In general, it's important to eat about every three to four hours.  Some people may prefer to have four or five small meals a day, whereas others may stick to three meals daily.  This timeline may differ for everyone, but it's still not healthy to skip meals.
One study showed that when mice ate just one large meal per day and fasted the rest of the day, their insulin resistance and abdominal fat increased.
Plan for quick or easy-to-prepare meals to make it easier to stay consistent with your eating schedule.  Foods like individual yogurts, fruit, nuts, hard-boiled eggs, cheese sticks, or a protein shake are easy to eat on the run and require minimal prep work.

Step 2: Eat a protein and fiber-rich breakfast.

Paragraph: 
When you're planning to eat more consistently, it's also important to eat the right foods in each of your meals.  This is especially true for breakfast.  This meal will pave the way for the rest of your day.

Studies have shown that breakfasts that are high in protein help lead to better hunger management during the day.  People felt more satisfied and showed reduced cravings during the day.

Breakfasts that also contained a high amount of fiber have been shown to be beneficial as well.  Fiber adds bulk to meals and takes longer to digest compared to low fiber foods.  This helps increase satisfaction and manage hunger throughout the day.
Examples of high protein, high fiber breakfasts include a small whole wheat tortilla with scrambled eggs and cheese, cottage cheese topped with fruit, whole grain oats topped with dried fruit and nuts or a breakfast smoothie made with Greek yogurt and fruit.

Step 3: Choose healthy snacks.

Paragraph: 
Many people think snacking will lead to weight gain.  However, smartly planned snacks between meals can help curb your appetite and provide a little energy throughout the day.

Do not let yourself become so hungry you overeat at mealtime.  If your next meal is more than one hour away, having a snack may help curb your appetite and prevent you from overeating.

Another appropriate time to snack would be before or after a workout.  Snacks can help provide your body with the energy it needs for a good workout or help your body recover from exercise.
If you're trying to lose weight, snacks shouldn't be more than 150 calories.  Snacks should also only be eaten when you are truly hungry, and it's appropriate to snack.
Healthy snacks include:  1/4 cup of nuts, whole grain pita chips with hummus, apple with 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml) of peanut butter or a small Greek yogurt.

Step 4: Take at least 20 minutes to eat your meals.

Paragraph: 
Studies have shown that the slower you eat, the more likely you are to feel satisfied after a meal.  Taking at least 20 minutes to eat your meal can help slow you down so you can feel satisfied sooner and with less food. Taking the time to eat mindfully and to enjoy every bite is a great way to prevent overeating and ensure that you're listening to your body.

Those who ate slower not only felt more satisfied but also consumed less food.  This may be due to the fact they realized they were satisfied and didn't eat until they were overly full.
Try these tricks to help yourself slow down:  set a timer for 20 minutes, put your fork down between each bite, drink more water between bites, talk to friends or family while you eat or count how many times you chew each bite.
Also do not get distracted while eating.  Turn off TVs and cell phones while you're eating.  Also, try not to read, check emails or do other work while you're eating.

Step 5: Stop eating when you're satisfied, not full.

Paragraph: 
When you eat until you're too full or overly full, you're most likely consuming too many calories for your body's needs.  This is not a healthy habit to continue as it could cause weight gain.

It may be difficult to tell when you're only ""satisfied.""  It takes about 20 minutes for your brain and stomach to communicate that feeling.  That's why it's important to eat slowly.
In general, satisfaction may feel like:  a lack of hunger, disinterest in your food, a very slight stretching sensation or the feeling that you won't need to eat again for a few hours.  When you're satisfied, you should leave some food on your plate.
When you're eating until you're full, you may feel:  uncomfortable, bloated, sick, a significant stretching sensation in your stomach.  When you're full, you most likely cleared your plate or had additional servings of food.

Step 6: Instill good eating habits in your kids.

Paragraph: 
If you're trying to improve your eating habits, you may also want to improve the eating habits of your entire family.

Kids can be a difficult group to get to eat healthy.  However, they are quick to learn and imitate behaviors they see in their parents.

Cooking together with your kids and taking them to the grocery store can help them feel involved, more excited to try new foods and eat healthier.

Introduce new foods slowly to kids. If you're just starting to eat better at home, your kids might not jump on the bandwagon so quickly.  Be patient with them as they adjust their tastes to your new eating pattern.
Get creative with your meals and snacks.  Making foods look fun and interesting can help kids feel more comfortable trying new items.  For example:  make a smiley face out of cut-up fruit, or make ""ants on a log"" (celery spread with peanut butter and topped with raisins).

Step 1: Choose lean protein sources.

Paragraph: 
Lean protein is an essential nutrient in your diet.  It provides the basis for the majority of your body's processes and functions.  Choosing healthy, lean sources of protein at each meal can help meet your body's needs each day.

In general, one serving of protein is about 3-4 ounces.  This is the size of your palm or a deck of cards.
Most of your protein choices should be lean.  These contain higher amounts of protein and less fat which can help support a healthy weight.  Choose items like poultry, eggs, lean beef, seafood, legumes, pork, tofu or low-fat dairy products.
It's appropriate to eat higher fat protein sources on occasion.  However, these types of foods should not be the main source of your protein.

Step 2: Eat five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables daily.

Paragraph: 
Both fruits and vegetables are low in calories and incredibly nutrient-rich.  Eating adequate servings of these foods can help you reach a variety of your nutrient goals each day.

One serving of fruits is 1/2 cup or one small piece of fruit.  One serving of vegetables is one cup or two cups of leafy green vegetables.  Make half of your plate a fruit or vegetable to help you meet your daily goals.
Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables that are deep in color.  These contain more nutrients compared to paler vegetables.  For example, choose spinach over iceberg lettuce or choose butternut squash over yellow summer squash.
Also choose a wide variety of fruits and vegetables each day and week.  You will limit your nutrition if you only eat one or two types of fruits and vegetables.

Step 3: Choose whole grains over refined grains.

Paragraph: 
When you're eating foods like bread, rice or pasta, it's beneficial to eat 100% whole grains instead of refined grains.

Whole grains are less processed and contain the entire grain — bran, endosperm and germ.  These foods are typically higher in fiber, protein and other essential nutrients.  Choose items like brown rice, quinoa, whole grain oats or 100% whole wheat bread.
Refined grains are those that are more processed and generally do not contain the nutrient containing parts of the grain.  Refined grains are lower in fiber, protein and other nutrients.  Items like white bread, plain pasta or white rice are refined grains.
One serving of grains is about 1 ounce.  That could be one slice of bread or about 1/2 cup of pasta or rice.  Include three to four servings of these foods each day.

Step 4: Limit highly processed junk foods.

Paragraph: 
These types of foods generally contain more sugar, fat, sodium and overall calories.  To help promote a healthy diet and weight, it's important to reduce the intake of these types of foods.

Limit foods like candy, cakes, cookies, pastries, frozen meals, processed meats and chips or crackers.
Try to eat mostly whole, minimally processed foods like raw fruits and vegetables, frozen or canned fruits and vegetables without sauces or seasonings, fresh or frozen protein without added sauces or seasonings, whole grains and low-fat dairy products.

Step 4: Drink more water.

Paragraph: 
Adequate hydration is an essential component of a healthy eating plan.  Adequate hydration helps your body function normally.

Everyone needs a different amount of hydrating fluids each day. New guidelines suggest this method to find out how many ounces to drink each day: divide your weight in half, and that will give you the number of ounces of fluids you should consume. If you weigh 150 lbs. you should drink 75 oz or a little over nine cups. Try to drink this much as your initial goal.  You may change this amount as you continue to work on your diet.
Choose fluids that are sugar-free and decaffeinated as they hydrate you the best. Items like water, flavored water, decaf coffee and tea are appropriate types of beverages.

Reduce or cut out sweetened beverages.  The consumption of sweetened beverages may lead to weight gain.  Cut out sodas, juices, sweet teas and alcohol.

Step 6: Considering taking supplements.

Paragraph: 
Vitamin and mineral supplements may help you maintain your healthy eating pattern.  These supplements can add extra nutrition to your diet.  This may be particularly useful for people with food allergies, diet restrictions or are picky eaters.

Consider taking a multivitamin.  This is a general supplement that contains a wide variety of vitamins and minerals.  These are an excellent, all-purpose type of supplement.
Consider an additional iron supplement.  Some people, especially females who are menstruating, may need additional iron.
Vitamin B12 is typically found in animal foods, and those who are vegetarian or vegan may need an additional B12 supplement.

Vitamin and mineral supplements are not to be relied upon heavily or used in place of real, whole foods.  They are meant to be a supplement to a healthy, well-balanced diet.
Always check with your doctor before starting any vitamin or mineral supplement.  Not all supplements are safe and appropriate for everyone.

Question: Bleach Skin with Peroxide
Part title: Face Mask Cream
Step 1: Add flour, milk, and 3% hydrogen peroxide to a plastic bowl.

Paragraph: 
Measure 2.5 tbsp (20 g) of flour, 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of milk, and 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of 3% hydrogen peroxide, which you can buy at your local drug store. As you measure out the ingredients, add them to a plastic container.

Try to get your measurements as exact as possible. Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful bleaching agent, and it might irritate your skin if it’s not balanced out by the milk and flour.
Milk hydrates your skin and may exfoliate away dead skin cells to reveal more youthful skin.
