Write a paragraph about a step in the question:
Question: How to Be a Better Stage Actor
Part title: Learning from Experience
Step 1: Meet a wide array of people and observe them.
Paragraph:
People watching is a great way to learn how to mimic expressions, gestures, and tones of voice. Observe strangers while youâ€™re out and about, and try to interact with a diverse range of people. Paying attention can inspire you to come up with the details that make a performance great.
- Coffee shops, restaurant patios, malls, and grocery stores are all great people watching places. If you're in line somewhere, say hello to the people next to you and try to strike up a conversation.
